# Super Tweet Club

A chrome extension that puts a backchannel chat room in your twitter. It looks like [this](http://cl.ly/Y2lv/Image%202014-10-15%20at%201.27.21%20PM.png). If your browser is narrow it might also show up like [this](http://cl.ly/image/1R0H2K3u1N2D).

## Why Join

Sometimes you just wanna chat with people. Tweeting is too permanent, too public, and not fluid enough to carry on a real conversation. The Super Tweet Club is full of smart, friendly people who are just like you. We like hanging out and talking. Consider it your local tavern, except on the internet.

We built it into Twitter because, even though chatting is fun, it's really hard to remember to go to a new URL all the time. We thought Twitter is the place you go when you're in the mood for this kind of thing.

## How to Join

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/nbashaw/supertweetclub/archive/master.zip) of Super Tweet Club.
2. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the Super Tweet Club folder (make sure "Developer mode" in the top-right corner is checked). If you're using Windows, you'll need to unzip the folder first, and it might take a little while to populate in the list.
4. Go to [http://twitter.com](http://twitter.com) and join in the fun!

## How To Leave

Not for you? No worries. Open [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), find the Super Tweet Club, and click the little trash can icon. We'll miss you, but we understand and support your decision.
